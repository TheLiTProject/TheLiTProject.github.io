    <h1>Will other games besides those one be featured?</h1>
    <p>Probably. There are many games on my mind that I want to document that are not Looney Tunes.<br>But honestly, only time will tell.<br>If other games will be covered here, it will probably be other, somewhat unknown mascot platformers (Something like Donald Duck: Quack Attack). But like I said, only time will tell.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h1>Who is working on this project?</h1>
    <p>For now, only one person. The owner of this site is Danin Sad≈æak, online known as sadzake or Boofny. You can check my work <a href="https://github.com/sadzake" target="_blank">here.</a><br>In the future however, I hope that more people will contribute to the project.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h1>Will this be only game documentation?</h1>
    <p>For the most part, yes. However, I do plan on creating more stuff for this project in the future. I have some stuff in mind that I want to work on, but due to my lack of knowledge it can't be done. <br>However, expect a lot of stuff in the future!</p>
    <br><br>
    <h1>Why are you making this project?</h1>
    <p>Just for the fun of it, honestly. I am a big Looney Tunes fan, and I am an even bigger fan of the games published by Infogrames. <br>I played them when I was little, and I still come back to them, they hold a special place in my heart.<br>So when I found out that basically no one remembers the game, and that's one of the biggest reasons as to why I'm making this project. To make the games at least little bit more popular.<br>And also this is my first ever web dev project, and I'm a beginner at this, so I figured why not make a site documenting the games that I love so much.</p>
