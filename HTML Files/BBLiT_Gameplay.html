        <h1>Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time</h1>
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>In Lost in Time, Bugs has the ability to kick, jump, pick up objects, roll, jump into rabbit holes to move underground, tiptoe to avoid alerting other enemies, climb ropes, use his rabbit ears like a propeller to slowly descend to the ground from high places.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Bugs can also move some objects to get to certain places.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The enemies in this game are very simple to beat. Most are defeated by either a jump or kick (or a combination of both), while others require Bugs to be chased until they run out of breath, then they can be kicked in the back. <br> Some enemies can be squished, and while squished, Bugs can jump on them to get more height. You can also get more height by jumping off trampoline-like obstacles.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are also special abilities Bugs can learn later in the game by talkin to Merlin, those include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>High Jump - This ability allows Bugs to jump higher than usual, making it possible to reach some levels and areas.</li>
            <li>Playing the piano - This ability allows Bugs to play a tune on the Piano, and it is used to unlock parts of some levels.</li>
        </ul>
