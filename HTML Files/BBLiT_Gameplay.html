        <h1>Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time</h1>
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>In Lost in Time, Bugs has the ability to kick, jump, pick up objects, roll, jump into rabbit holes to move underground, tiptoe to avoid alerting other enemies, climb ropes, use his rabbit ears like a propeller to slowly descend to the ground from high places.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Bugs can also move some objects to get to certain places.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The enemies in this game are very simple to beat. Most are defeated by either a jump or kick (or a combination of both), while others require Bugs to be chased until they run out of breath, then they can be kicked in the back. <br> Some enemies can be squished, and while squished, Bugs can jump on them to get more height. You can also get more height by jumping off trampoline-like obstacles.</p>
